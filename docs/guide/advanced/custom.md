# Custom Components

The realization of business custom components mainly uses the Hooks API and observer API in [@formily/react](https://react.formilyjs.org) or [@formily/vue](https://vue.formilyjs.org).

To access the ready-made component library, we mainly use connect/mapProps/mapReadPretty API.

If you want to implement some more complex custom components, we strongly recommend looking directly at the source code of [@formily/antd](https://github.com/alibaba/formily/tree/formily_next/packages/antd/src) or [@formily/next](https://github.com/alibaba/formily/tree/formily_next/packages/next/src).
